        <p Class="Hari">1961: The ANITA:<br>
The first all-electronic desktop calculator, the British Bell Punch/Sumlock Comptometer ANITA (A New Inspiration To Arithmetic/Accounting), used vacuum tubes, cold-cathode tubes, and Dekatrons in its circuits, with 12 cold-cathode "Nixie" tubes for its display. 
1967: The "Cal Tech" Prototype:<br>
Texas Instruments developed a prototype of a handheld calculator, codenamed "Cal Tech", which was released commercially in 1970. 
1970: Commercial Handheld Calculator:<br>
The first commercially available handheld calculator featured a small keyboard with 18 keys and a visual output that displayed up to 12 decimal digits. 
1974: HP-65:<br>
Hewlett-Packard developed a programmable device, the HP-65, which was advertised as a "personal computer" rather than just a calculator. 
<p class="Hari">Key Features and Significance:<br>
Programmability:<br>
The HP-65's ability to store and execute programs was a key feature that set it apart from earlier calculators and brought it closer to the concept of a computer. 
Portability:<br>
Handheld calculators, like the "Cal Tech" prototype, revolutionized how calculations were performed, making them more accessible and convenient. 
Transition to Computing:<br>
The development of programmable calculators like the HP-65 paved the way for the emergence of personal computers, as they demonstrated the potential of small, portable devices for more than just simple calculations</p>
